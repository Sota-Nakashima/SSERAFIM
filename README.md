## Description
This tool simplifies and automates the workflow of gene expression analysis.
It estimates the expression level of each gene based on the SRR list downloaded from [SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra), genome reference, and annotation data.
Although this tool only supports a single species, it can be used to analyze multiple species if it combinates with [AESPA](https://github.com/Sota-Nakashima/AESPA), which is being developed separately.
